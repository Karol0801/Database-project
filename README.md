This project was a collaborative effort between <a href="https://github.com/paula078">Paulina</a> , <a href="https://github.com/king-zar">Kinga</a>., and myself for the Database Systems course at AGH University during the academic year 2023/2024.

The primary objective of the project was to design and implement a database for a company offering a diverse range of studies, courses, and webinars.

The project encompassed the following stages:

Creating the database from scratch.
Populating each table with exemplary data.
Developing views, functions, procedures, and triggers.
The complete project description can be found <a href="https://github.com/Soamid/obiektowe-lab/tree/master/proj">here</a>.

Below is the ER diagram of the created database:
